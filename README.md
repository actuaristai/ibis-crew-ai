## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure deployment - [Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- **make**: Build automation tool - [Install](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)


## Quick Start (Local Testing)

Install required packages and launch the local development environment:

```bash
make install && make playground
```

set up gcloud authentication
`gcloud auth application-default login`
`gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project ace-world-453411-e9`
`gcloud config project ace-world-453411-e9`

## Commands

| Command              | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make install`       | Install all required dependencies using uv                                                  |
| `make playground`    | Launch local development environment with backend and frontend |
| `make backend`       | Start backend server only |
| `make ui`            | Launch Streamlit frontend without local backend |
| `make test`          | Run unit and integration tests                                                              |
| `make lint`          | Run code quality checks (codespell, ruff, mypy)                                             |
| `make setup-dev-env` | Set up development environment resources using Terraform                                    |
| `uv run jupyter lab` | Launch Jupyter notebook                                                                     |

## Usage

This template follows a "bring your own agent" approach - you focus on your business logic, and the template handles everything else (UI, infrastructure, deployment, monitoring).

1. **Prototype:** Build your Generative AI Agent using the intro notebooks in `notebooks/` for guidance. Use Vertex AI Evaluation to assess performance.
2. **Integrate:** Import your agent into the app by editing `app/agent.py`.
3. **Test:** Explore your agent functionality using the Streamlit playground with `make playground`. The playground offers features like chat history, user feedback, and various input types, and automatically reloads your agent on code changes.
4. **Deploy:** Set up and initiate the CI/CD pipelines, customizing tests as necessary. Refer to the [deployment section](#deployment) for comprehensive instructions. For streamlined infrastructure deployment, simply run `agent-starter-pack setup-cicd`. Check out the [`agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` CLI command](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack/blob/main/docs/cli/setup_cicd.md). Currently only supporting Github.
5. **Monitor:** Track performance and gather insights using Cloud Logging, Tracing, and the Looker Studio dashboard to iterate on your application.


## Deployment

> **Note:** For a streamlined one-command deployment of the entire CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure using Terraform, you can use the [`agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` CLI command](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack/blob/main/docs/cli/setup_cicd.md). Currently only supporting Github.

### Dev Environment
Deploy the application directly to Cloud Run from your source code using the following `gcloud` command:

```bash
gcloud run deploy genai-app-sample \
  --source . \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --region YOUR_GCP_REGION \
  --memory "4Gi" \
```
Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID and `YOUR_GCP_REGION` with the desired region (e.g., `us-central1`). Adjust memory and other flags as needed for your environment.


The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of the Dev Google Cloud project.
See [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for instructions.

### Production Deployment

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of a production Google Cloud project. Refer to [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy the infrastructure and application.


## Monitoring and Observability

> You can use [this Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/reporting/fa742264-4b4b-4c56-81e6-a667dd0f853f/page/tEnnC) template for visualizing events being logged in BigQuery. See the "Setup Instructions" tab to getting started.

The application uses OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability with all events being sent to Google Cloud Trace and Logging for monitoring and to BigQuery for long term storage.
